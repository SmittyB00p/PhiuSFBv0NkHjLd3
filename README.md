# Potential Talents Overview




## About the Dataset
This dataset is comprised of a candidates unique index number, their job title, their location, number of connections they have, and a fit column that will be used to rank the candidate on how well their job title corresponds to the job title that the hiring personel are looking for.

Below, the word cloud represents the number of unique words in the job_title feature of this dataset. The larger the word is in the cloud the more times it shows up in candidates' job titles.

Certain stop words have been omitted from the feature, such as numbers, articles such as 'a', 'an', and 'the', as well as some prepositions such as 'with' and 'without'.
